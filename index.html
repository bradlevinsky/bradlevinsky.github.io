                        This is placeholder text: All leaders, to a certain degree, do the same thing. Whether you’re talking about an executive, sports coach,
                        or schoolteacher, leadership is enabling others to accomplish something they couldn’t do on their own. Some people in
                        formal leadership positions are poor leaders, and many good leaders have no formal authority. In this sense, leadership is
                        something you do and not something you are. It is a person’s actions, rather than their words or job title, that inspire trust and commitment.

                        To explain a bit about this page, it contains a fixed header at the top of the screen. Within the header is my name
                        and letting you know this is my web space. On the left, there is an icon that drops down a navigation menu that
                        will allow you to navigate my web space. The menu will eventually include a scrollbar for easier navigation.
                        Right now, there are two options: the About page and the Projects page.
                        On the top right, I have an image of the Sheridan logo that is mapped, and when clicked, it will bring you to the Sheridan website.
                    </p>

                        Even more placeholder text: There are many contexts and ways in which leadership is exercised. According to McKinsey analysis of
                        academic literature and a global survey of nearly 200,000 people in 81 organizations, there are four types of behaviors that account
                        for 89 percent of leadership effectiveness:

                    <p>
                        The new items in my Projects Page include the PDF viewer, which uses an &lt;iframe&gt;, and a username/password form using &lt;form&gt;.
                        The usable username and password are in a comment along with my initial assignment submission message.

                <li class="mb-4">
                    <p>
                        In the About Page, I have added a gallery in the middle to list different movies. The sidebar contains hyperlinks that jump to the
                        relevant section with the movie details. Clicking on the images opens them in a new tab, without navigating away from the current screen.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li class="mb-4">
                    <p>
                        New styling features include using multiple classes, z-index, overflow-y, and other elements not explicitly covered in the lessons.
                        I’ve added comments in the styling file and kept similar styling elements grouped together for easier readability.
