                    This is my portfolio that showcases the progress I have made during my INFO16206 Scripting and Web Languages class.
                </h3>
                <ul>

                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            To explain a bit about this page, it contains a fixed header at the top of the screen. Within the header is my name
                            and letting you know this is my web space. On the left there is an icon that drops down a navigation menu. that will
                            allow you to navigate my web space. The menu when enough items get added to it will have an it's own scroll bar that
                            will allow for easier navigation. Right now there are two options, Go to the about page and to go to the projects page.
                            On the top right i have an image of the sheridan logo that has been mapped and when clicked it will bring you to the sheridan website.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The new items in my Projects Page are the pdf viewer which is using &lt;iframe&gt;
                            and the username and password which uses &lt;form&gt;. The usable username and
                            words are in a comment along with my initial assignement submission message.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The news item in the About Page is the Gallery. In the middle i used gallery to list out
                            different movies. In the bar on the side there is list of hyperlinks that jump to the section
                            that has the movie there. Also if you click on the images it will open in a new screen
                            instead of changing the current screen to the website.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            There are also some new items in the styling, adding multiple classes to an area, z-index, overflow-y
                            and some other items that were not explicity taught in the lessons. In my syling file I also
                            tried to have comments and keep all my similar stylings together.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
