                        This is placeholder text: All leaders, to a certain degree, do the same thing. Whether you’re talking about an executive, sports coach,
                        or schoolteacher, leadership is enabling others to accomplish something they couldn’t do on their own. Some people in
                        formal leadership positions are poor leaders, and many good leaders have no formal authority. In this sense, leadership is
                        something you do and not something you are. It is a person’s actions, rather than their words or job title, that inspire trust and commitment.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li class="mb-4">
                    <p>
                        More placeholder text: What’s more, leadership is not something people are born with. Because good leadership is often expressed through
                        behavior rather than personality, it is a skill that can be learned. How? Getting to know oneself is a key first step.
                        The most effective leaders are highly conscious of their own thoughts and beliefs and show up with integrity as their fully authentic selves.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li class="mb-4">
                    <p>
                        Even more placeholder text: There are many contexts and ways in which leadership is exercised. According to McKinsey analysis of
                        academic literature and a global survey of nearly 200,000 people in 81 organizations, there are four types of behaviors that account
                        for 89 percent of leadership effectiveness:
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li class="mb-4">
                    <p>
                        And more palceholder text: Effective leaders know that what works in one situation will not necessarily work every time.
                        Leadership strategies must reflect an organization’s context. For example, a situational approach enables executives to focus on
                        the leadership behaviors that are most relevant to the organization as it evolves.
