            <h4 class="mt-4">Why We Exist</h4>
            <p>
                For many people, keeping their homes safe and functional feels out of reach. FixIt Forward was built to empower people, not only by providing help but by offering mentorship that builds lasting knowledge and connection. We believe housing should be stable, dignified, and supported by community.
            </p>

            <h4 class="mt-5">Our Founder</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Brad Levinsky</strong> created FixIt Forward after working in both the HVAC and renovation industries. He witnessed firsthand how difficult it can be for homeowners to get affordable, trustworthy help, and how many skilled retirees still want to give back. Brad launched this project to connect those two groups in a way that’s practical, empowering, and filled with heart.
